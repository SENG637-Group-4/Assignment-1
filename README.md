[1 Introduction	1](#_Toc439194677)

This lab focuses on gaining practical experience in software testing and defect tracking using an ATM simulation system as the System Under Test (SUT). The main objective of the lab is to understand and apply different testing approaches, including exploratory testing, manual scripted (functional) testing, and regression testing. The ATM simulation system provides common banking operations such as deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and balance inquiries, which allows testers to evaluate both functional correctness and usability.

In this lab, we conduct exploratory and scripted tests on ATM System version 1.0, which is provided in the archive `/assignment1-artifacts.zip` under the file name `ATM System - Lab 1 Version 1.0.jar`. Any defects discovered during these testing phases are recorded in the Jira backlog.

After documenting the identified defects, regression testing is performed on the updated release of the application, ATM System version 1.1, also included in `/assignment1-artifacts.zip` as `ATM System - Lab 1 Version 1.1.jar`. The status of previously reported issues is then reviewed and updated in the Jira backlog based on whether the defects have been resolved or remain present.

[2 High-level description of the exploratory testing plan	1](#_Toc439194678)

Our exploratory testing plan focused on understanding the core functionalities of the ATM simulation system and identifying defects through unscripted interaction with the interface. The primary functions targeted during this phase were:

- Authentication (card number and PIN)
- Deposit
- Withdrawal
- Transfer between accounts
- Balance inquiry
- Transaction receipts/ logs
- Session termination and card ejection
- System on/off behavior
  
Our approach was broad-first then deep. We initially tested all major functions lightly to gain familiarity with the system. After that, we selected a few high-risk or complex functions (such as transfer and withdrawal) and tested them more extensively.
Test case ideas were derived from:

- Test typical user activities like successful login, regular deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and balance inquiries
- Explore what the user can potentially do when he visits the ATM, like pressing incorrect buttons or navigating menus in unusual orders
- After each transaction, verify account balances and system logs to ensure the operation was recorded accurately
- Review the generated receipt to confirm that all transaction details are correct and complete
- Evaluate boundary conditions (depositing $0, very large amounts ...)
- Exceptional paths (wrong PIN, negative numbers, cancel operations ...)
- Usability behaviors (pressing unexpected buttons, repeated inputs ...)

We also varied: Account types (Checking, Savings, Money Market)

The goal of this phase was not to cover every scenario, but to uncover unexpected behaviors, crashes, or inconsistencies without relying on predefined scripts.

# Introduction

In this lab work, we will be performing manually exploratory tests, scripted tests and regression tests on the given ATM simulation system v1.0. It is available inside the zip archive with path `/assignment1-ATM.zip`, and the file name is `ATM System - Lab 1 Version 1.0.jar`.

If we find any bug during exploratory/scripted testing, we will log it in Jira Backlog following the requirement of assignment 1.

Then for each bug found, we will perform regression testing on the updated version of the given system, and update its status in the Jira Backlog. The updated sytem is available inside the zip archive with path `/assignment1-ATM.zip`, and the file name is `ATM System - Lab 1 Version 1.1.jar`.

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 

The testing work was shared among the team using a collaborative approach.

**Exploratory Testing:**
First, we started by exploring the system to understand how it works. Based on that, we created a high-level test plan. Then, two pairs from our team tested the system separately and took notes. Finally, each pair reviewed the issues they found and reported them in Jira.

**Manual Scripted Testing:**
We completed this task as a team. Each team member executed 10 test cases, while the other members tracked the completed tests and reported any defects. Shuvam Agarwala executed test cases 1–10, followed by Zohara Kamal (11–20), Minh Le (21–30), and Thanoshan Vijayanandan (31–40).

**Regression Testing:**
We completed this task as a group. Each team member who reported defects in the previous two phases retested the same test cases on version 1.1 and updated the defect status, while the other members reviewed.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

Since we conducted exploratory testing individually from remote locations, each team member reported a similar set of defects. Although we checked for existing defects before creating new ones to reduce duplication, some duplicate reports were still created. Removing these duplicates was challenging because the same issues were described using different titles and descriptions.

To resolve this, we met in person at the university, discussed the reported defects, and removed the duplicates. Some reported defects were also not reproducible, so we retested them together and removed the invalid reports.

This experience showed us how important teamwork is. Everyone must be aligned on what needs to be done and understand how their efforts fit into the group's work.

# Comments/feedback on the lab and lab document itself

1. The detailed and comprehensive assignment document (seng637-a1.md) helped us clearly understand and complete the required tasks.
2. Through this assignment, we gained hands-on experience in key testing activities used in the software industry. Further, the selected system was appropriate because it allowed us to perform all three types of testing in sequence.
