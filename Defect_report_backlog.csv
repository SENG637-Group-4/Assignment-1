10. Total balance will be shown as $-9.0-50, which isn't even a valid number

*Expected outcome:*

In version 1.0, the ATM shouldn't allow the transfer as the total balance of $90.00 is less than the amount being transferred, which is $100.00.



*Actual outcome:*

The ATM allows to transfer more than the total balance present in the checking account. Also, the final figure shown in the balance inquiry is not a valid numeral.
